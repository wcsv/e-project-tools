# e-project-tools
A collection of tools intended to add support for directory-based projects to Emacs.

This project is in early development and will likely be changing often.

Features Currently Implemented:
- Specify a project root directory
- Import all code files under the root directory into your project (currently only C/H files are supported)
- Tag your project files with ETags and load the resulting tags table
- Search within all project files using grep

Next Up:
- Add support for additional languages
- Add support for project setup files that will contain config info about the project
- Add ability to list all project files in a selectable buffer
- will add to this list as I work
